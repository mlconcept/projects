# Product Classification of Amazon

Amazon is the largest e-commerce and cloud computing website in the world and hosts million of products. 
This is a classification model that classifies 57,000 products on Amazon, using image of the product, ASIN, 
product title and product brand. An ensemble of classification models are used to predcit the final classes of 
the products. 

Since the project is limited to only 63 catagories of classification, only electronic products hosted on the website are used. 
A combination of Tf-Learn and tensorflow are used as packages for classification. The combined classification 
accuracy is calculated to be 83%, possibly because the number of training samples per class is around 100, whcih is pretty less 
for achieving high accuracy in DNN.
