# E-commerce-product-image-classification
Build a model that automatically classifies the products based on their images for Cdiscount.com

## Background
[Cdiscount.com](https://www.cdiscount.com) is France's largest non-food e-commerce company. By the end of this year, Cdiscount.com will have over 30 million products up for sale. Ensuring that so many products are well classified is a challenging task.
In this project, I build a model that can auto-classify the products based on their images. There are almost 9 million products, with more than 15 million images at 180x180 resolution in this dataset. Theree are more than 5000 categories to classify these products into!

## Method

Keras tensorflow multiplyer NN

## Reference

## Final note
Data too big and my macbook doesn't have enough memory and storage after all.
